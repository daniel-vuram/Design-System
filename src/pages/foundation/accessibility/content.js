      <h2>What is an atomic design system?</h2>
      <p>
        Atomic design is a methodology for creating design systems that
        emphasizes the creation and organization of design components at a
        modular level. It was introduced by Brad Frost and is used to streamline
        and scale the design and development process by breaking down interfaces
        into smaller, reusable parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term "atomic" refers to the analogy with the atomic elements in
        chemistry, where atoms are the building blocks of matter. Similarly, in
        atomic design, components are the fundamental building blocks of an
        interface. These components are organized into a hierarchy based on
        their complexity and how they combine to form larger elements.{" "}
      </p>
      <h5 className="mb-3">
        The five levels of the atomic design methodology are:
      </h5>
      <h5>1. Atoms: The Fundamental Building Blocks</h5>

      <p>
        Atoms are the elemental particles of a design system. They encompass the
        simplest UI elements, such as buttons, input fields, icons, and
        typography. These atomic components are the foundation upon which the
        entire design system is constructed. Individually, atoms might appear
        mundane, but collectively, they form the basis for more complex UI
        elements.
      </p>

      <h5>2. Molecules: Functional Combinations</h5>
      <p>
        Molecules arise from the fusion of atoms. They represent groups of atoms
        working together harmoniously to fulfill specific functions. Examples of
        molecules include search bars, which amalgamate an input field atom, a
        search button atom, and perhaps a text label atom. Molecules serve as
        the functional units that facilitate user interactions.
      </p>

      <h5>3. Organisms: Complex Components with Purpose</h5>
      <p>
        Organisms are higher-level components that combine molecules and atoms
        to create more intricate UI sections. These components, such as
        navigation bars, headers, and product cards, encapsulate meaningful
        sections of the user interface. Organisms contribute to both modularity
        and consistency, enabling designers and developers to efficiently manage
        and update complex structures.
      </p>
      <h5>4. Templates: Blueprinting Layouts</h5>
      <p>
        Templates define the layout and arrangement of organisms and molecules
        within a given screen or page. They serve as blueprints, guiding the
        placement of different components while maintaining consistency across
        various pages. Templates provide a systematic framework for designers to
        create consistent and visually appealing designs.
      </p>
      <h5>Pages: Realisation of the Design System</h5>
      <p>
        Pages are the tangible manifestations of the design system. They combine
        templates, organisms, molecules, and atoms to create fully realised user
        interfaces with real content. Pages showcase how the design system comes
        to life in actual user interactions, representing the culmination of the
        Atomic Design process.
