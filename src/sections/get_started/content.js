      <h2>Why do we need a design system?</h2>
      <p>
        A design system serves as a guiding light, ensuring everyone speaks the
        same design language. It acts as a central hub for visual elements, UI
        patterns, and guidelines. This consistency not only fosters a harmonious
        look but also accelerates design and development processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        As our company expands, navigating through the complexities of product
        design without a design system is akin to a maze. With our design
        system, the path is clear, scaling effortlessly to introduce new
        products and features while maintaining a consistent user experience
      </p>
      <p>
        Updates and improvements become seamless, with a single change rippling
        across the organization. Users benefit from a system that prioritizes
        user-friendliness and accessibility, creating an intuitive bridge
        between our products and users
      </p>
      <p>
        This also helps the team when new team members join, they're not
        overwhelmed by a mishmash of design choices. Instead, they're welcomed
        by a comprehensive guide that helps them hit the ground running. It's
        like handing them a treasure map that leads to design success. The best
        part? A design system isn't static. It evolves with us, adapting to new
        technologies, trends, and user preferences.

      <h2>What is an atomic design system?</h2>
      <p>
        Atomic design is a methodology for creating design systems that
        emphasizes the creation and organization of design components at a
        modular level. It was introduced by Brad Frost and is used to streamline
        and scale the design and development process by breaking down interfaces
        into smaller, reusable parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term "atomic" refers to the analogy with the atomic elements in
        chemistry, where atoms are the building blocks of matter. Similarly, in
        atomic design, components are the fundamental building blocks of an
        interface. These components are organized into a hierarchy based on
        their complexity and how they combine to form larger elements.
      </p>
      <h5 className="mb-3">
        The five levels of the atomic design methodology are:
      </h5>
      <h5>1. Atoms: The Fundamental Building Blocks</h5>
      <p>
        Atoms are the elemental particles of a design system. They encompass the
        simplest UI elements, such as buttons, input fields, icons, and
        typography. These atomic components are the foundation upon which the
        entire design system is constructed. Individually, atoms might appear
        mundane, but collectively, they form the basis for more complex UI
        elements.
      </p>

      <h5>2. Molecules: Functional Combinations</h5>
      <p>
        Molecules arise from the fusion of atoms. They represent groups of atoms
        working together harmoniously to fulfill specific functions. Examples of
        molecules include search bars, which amalgamate an input field atom, a
        search button atom, and perhaps a text label atom. Molecules serve as
        the functional units that facilitate user interactions.
      </p>

      <h5>3. Organisms: Complex Components with Purpose</h5>
      <p>
        Organisms are higher-level components that combine molecules and atoms
        to create more intricate UI sections. These components, such as
        navigation bars, headers, and product cards, encapsulate meaningful
        sections of the user interface. Organisms contribute to both modularity
        and consistency, enabling designers and developers to efficiently manage
        and update complex structures.
      </p>

      <h5>4. Templates: Blueprinting Layouts</h5>
      <p>
        Templates define the layout and arrangement of organisms and molecules
        within a given screen or page. They serve as blueprints, guiding the
        placement of different components while maintaining consistency across
        various pages. Templates provide a systematic framework for designers to
        create consistent and visually appealing designs.
      </p>

      <h5>5. Pages: Realisation of the Design System</h5>
      <p>
        Pages are the tangible manifestations of the design system. They combine
        templates, organisms, molecules, and atoms to create fully realised user
        interfaces with real content. Pages showcase how the design system comes
        to life in actual user interactions, representing the culmination of the
        Atomic Design process.

      <h2>Utilizing an atomic design system</h2>
      <p>
        An Atomic Design System serves as a robust foundation for designing and
        developing digital products across various contexts, including:
      </p>

      <h5>1. No-Code Platforms:</h5>
      <p>
        For no-code platforms, an Atomic Design System empowers users with
        limited technical skills to create and customise design elements. It
        offers a structured framework to maintain design consistency while
        simplifying the process of interface creation.
      </p>
      <h5>2. Web and Mobile Applications:</h5>
      <p>
        In the realm of web and mobile apps, an Atomic Design System ensures
        that design elements remain consistent and visually appealing across
        different screens and devices. It expedites the design and development
        process by providing a library of pre-designed components.
      </p>
      <h5>3. Branding and Marketing:</h5>
      <p>
        The design system becomes a repository for brand elements like colours,
        typography, and logos, ensuring brand consistency across marketing
        materials and digital touch-points.
      </p>
      <h5>4. Collaborative Design and Development:</h5>
      <p>
        An Atomic Design System fosters collaboration between designers and
        developers. Designers create components while developers implement them,
        streamlining communication and enhancing efficiency.
